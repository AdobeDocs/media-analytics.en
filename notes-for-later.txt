- After you complete the Table Cleanup Sweep Operation, go back and fix resulting formatting issues, which include:
    * Codeblocks in table cells, turned in to code format ( '`'...'`' )
    * Notes / other text that were in column spans, now crammed into one cell.
      These could be pulled out of the table and referred to with callouts?

-Put PDFs into their appropriate assets folders, and adjust links to them.
