# Install Media Analytics with Experience Platform Edge
<!-- Do all of the sections here apply to any type of implementation method? I think so... -->

{{release-limited-testing}}

Adobe Experience Platform Edge allows you to send data destined to multiple products to a centralized location. Experience Edge forwards the appropriate information to the desired products. This concept allows you to consolidate implementation efforts, especially spanning multiple data solutions.

The following graphic illustrates a Media Analytics implementation that uses Experience Platform Edge:

![Edge implementation](assets/media-analytics-implementation-overview.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Currently, you can send data to Experience Edge only using the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK.


<!-- Replace the above sentence with this after it web releases: You can send data to Experience Edge using any of the following implementation methods:

* Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK (Coming soon)
* Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK
* Edge Network Server API

Regardless of which Experience Edge implementation method you use for configuring media tracking, you must first complete the following sections:

## Define a report suite

>[!NOTE]
>
>A report suite is required only if you are using Adobe Analytics. A report suite is not needed if you plan to use Customer Journey Analytics for reporting.

If you plan to use Adobe Analytics for reporting, then you need to have a report suite to use with your Streaming Media implementation. For information about defining a report suite, see [Report Suite Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/manage-report-suites/report-suites-admin.html?lang=en).

After a report suite is defined, continue with [Set up the schema in Adobe Experience Platform](#set-up-the-schema-in-adobe-experience-platform).

## Set up the schema in Adobe Experience Platform 

To standardize data collection for use across applications that leverage Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe has created the open and publicly documented standard, Experience Data Model (XDM).

To create and set up a schema:

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, begin creating the schema as described in [Create and edit schemas in the UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/ui/resources/schemas.html?lang=en).

   When creating the schema, choose [!UICONTROL **XDM ExperienceEvent**] from the [!UICONTROL **Create schema**] drop-down menu.

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Composition**] area, in the [!UICONTROL **Field groups**] section, select [!UICONTROL **Add**], then search for and add the following new field groups to the schema:
   * `Adobe Analytics ExperienceEvent Template`
   * `Implementation Details`
   * `MediaAnalytics Interaction Details`

   After you add the field groups, they should display in the [!UICONTROL **Field groups**] section, as follows:
