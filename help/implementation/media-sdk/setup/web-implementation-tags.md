# Implement Analytics using the Media Analytics extension

You can use the Adobe Media Analytics extension to implement Analytics. The Media Analytics extension adds the core JavaScript Media SDK (Media 3.x SDK). This extension provides the functionality for adding the Media tracker instance to a tags-enabled site or project. 

For information about how to install and use the extension, see [Adobe Media Analytics (3.x SDK) for Audio and Video extension — using Tags (Data Collection)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extensions/adobe/media-analytics-3x/overview.html?lang=en).

Alternatively, you can implement Analytics using JavaScript, as described in [Implement Analytics using JavaScript](/help/implementation/media-sdk/setup/web-implementation.md).
