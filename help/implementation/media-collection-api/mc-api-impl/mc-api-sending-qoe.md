# Sending QoE data{#sending-qoe-data}

Every event can be decorated with an extra JSON key called `qoeData`, which is positioned alongside the `params` key in the JSON request body.

>
>You should check the [JSON validation schemas](mc-api-validate-reqs.md) to verify parameter types and whether they are mandatory or optional.
