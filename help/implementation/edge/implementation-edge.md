# Implement the Streaming Media Collection Add-on using the Edge Network 

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network allows you to send data destined to multiple products to a centralized location. Experience Edge forwards the appropriate information to the desired products. This concept allows you to consolidate implementation efforts, especially spanning multiple data solutions.

The following graphic illustrates how the Adobe Streaming Media Collection Add-on can be implemented to use Experience Platform Edge to make data available in Analysis Workspace, either in Adobe Analytics or Customer Journey Analytics:

![CJA workflow](assets/streaming-media-edge.png)

For an overview of all implementation options, including implementation methods that don't use Experience Platform Edge, see [Implement the Streaming Media Collection Add-on](/help/implementation/overview.md).

Regardless of whether you use the Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK, the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK, the Adobe Experience Platform Roku SDK, or the API to implement the Streaming Media Collection Add-on with Experience Edge, you must first complete the following sections:

## Set up the schema in Adobe Experience Platform 

To standardize data collection for use across applications that leverage Adobe Experience Platform, Adobe has created the open and publicly documented standard, Experience Data Model (XDM).

To create and set up a schema:

1. In Adobe Experience Platform, begin creating the schema as described in [Create and edit schemas in the UI](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/ui/resources/schemas.html?lang=en).

1. On the Schema details page when creating the schema, choose [!UICONTROL **Experience Event**] when choosing the base class for the schema.

   ![Added field groups](assets/schema-experience-event.png)

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Next**].

1. Specify a schema display name and description, then select [!UICONTROL **Finish**].

1. In the [!UICONTROL **Composition**] area, in the [!UICONTROL **Field groups**] section, select [!UICONTROL **Add**], then search for and add the following new field groups to the schema:
   * `Adobe Analytics ExperienceEvent Template`
   * `Implementation Details`
   * `MediaAnalytics Interaction Details`

   After you add the field groups, they should display in the [!UICONTROL **Field groups**] section, as follows:

   ![Added field groups](assets/schema-field-groups-added.png)

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Save**] to save your changes.

1. (Optional) You can hide certain fields that are not used by the Media Edge API. Hiding these fields makes the schema easier to read and understand, but it is not required. These fields refer only to those in the `MediaAnalytics Interaction Details` fieldgroup.

   +++ Expand here to view instructions on fields that you can hide.

   1. In the [!UICONTROL **Structure**] area, select the `Media Collection Details` field, then select [!UICONTROL **Manage related fields**].

1. Continue with [Create and configure a project in Customer Journey Analytics](#create-and-configure-a-project-in-customer-journey-analytics).

## Create and configure a project in Customer Journey Analytics

1. Ensure that you created a data view in Customer Journey Analytics as described in [Create a data view in Customer Journey Analytics](#create-a-new-data-view-in-customer-journey-analytics).

1. In Customer Journey Analytics, in the [!UICONTROL **Workspace**] tab, in the [!UICONTROL **Projects**] area, select [!UICONTROL **Create project**].

1. Select [!UICONTROL **Blank project**] > [!UICONTROL **Create**].

1. In the new project, select the data view that you previously created.

   When creating panels in your project, you can use any components that you added to your data view, as described in [Create a data view in Customer Journey Analytics](#create-a-new-data-view-in-customer-journey-analytics). 

   The following 4 panels are examples of panels that you could create:

   ![Main Content panel](assets/main-content-panel.png)

   ![Chapter and ads panel](assets/chapter-and-ads-panel.png)

   ![QoE panel](assets/qoe-panel.png)

   ![Plater state panel](assets/player-state-panel.png)

1. Select the **Panels** icon in the left rail, then drag in the [!UICONTROL **Media concurrent viewers**] panel and the [!UICONTROL **Media playback time spent**] panel. 

   The 2 panels should look like this:

   ![Media concurrent viewers panel](assets/media-concurrent-viewers-panels.png)

   ![Media playback time spent panel](assets/media-playback-time-spent-panels.png)

1. (Conditional) If you added custom metadata to your schema, as described in Step 8 of [Set up the schema in Adobe Experience Platform ](#set-up-the-schema-in-adobe-experience-platform), then you need to set the persistence for the custom fields, as described in [Persistence component settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-dataviews/component-settings/persistence) in the Customer Journey Analytics guide.

   When data arrives in Customer Journey Analytics, the Custom User ID dimension will be available.

   ![setup-custom-metadata](assets/custom-metadata-dimension.png)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >If you set up Adobe Analytics as an upstream for your datastream, the custom metadata is also present in ContextData, with the name that you set in the schema (without the tenant prefix e.g. myCustomField). This makes it possible to use all the Adobe Analytics features available for ContextData, such as [creating a processing rule](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/manage-report-suites/edit-report-suite/report-suite-general/c-processing-rules/processing-rules).

1. Share the project as described in [Share projects](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics-platform/using/cja-workspace/curate-share/share-projects.html?lang=en).

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >   If the users you want to share with are not available, make sure the users have user and admin access to Customer Journey Analytics in the Adobe Admin Console.
