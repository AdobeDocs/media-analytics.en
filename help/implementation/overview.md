# Implement Streaming Media for Adobe Analytics

The implementation path you follow depends on whether you choose to use the built-in logic of the Media SDKs (the standard, recommended implementation) or whether you choose to roll-your-own and use the simpleâ€”yet powerful and customizable Media Collection APIs (RESTful).

Choose the implementation path depending on the supported platforms. Some players are not supported by the Media SDKs or Adobe Experience Platform Media SDK, and the Media Collection APIs provide a way to support those players. For information on supported devices, see [Supported devices and platforms](/help/getting-started/supported-devices.md).
