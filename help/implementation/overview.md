# Implement Streaming Media for Adobe Analytics or Customer Journey Analytics

There are various ways to implement Streaming Media. For a detailed comparison of supported devices and platforms for the implementation methods described on this page, see [Supported devices and platforms](/help/getting-started/supported-devices.md).

## Edge implementation methods

For most cases, we recommend using Edge when implementing Media Analytics for all new Adobe Analytics or Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) customers.

* **Media for Edge Network SDK / Extension:** Collects data from iOS and Android devices and sends it to Edge. Data can then be sent either to CJA or Adobe Analytics. 

  For more information about the Media for Edge Network SDK / Extention, see [Install Media Analytics with Experience Platform Edge](/help/implementation/implementation-edge.md).

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >This implementation method does not currently support the Web SDK or Roku. However, both are supported when implementing with the Media Edge API.

* **Media Edge API:** Can be customized to collect data from any device or format (including, mobile, web, and over-the-top devices) and sends data to Edge. Data can then be sent either to CJA or Adobe Analytics. 

  <!-- For more information about the Media Edge API, see (link to John's docs when they're ready) -->

## Other implementation methods

For most cases, the Edge implementation methods described above are recommended for both CJA and Adobe Analytics, especially for new implementations.

In addition to the Edge implementation methods, other implementation methods are available. These implementation methods were initially designed for use with Adobe Analytics. However, customers with any of the following implementation methods can still make data available in CJA by creating an [Analytics source connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/sources/ui-tutorials/create/adobe-applications/analytics.html).

* **Media Extension with tags:** The Adobe Media Analytics for Audio and Video extension provides the functionality for adding the Media tracker instance to a tags-enabled site or project. Data is sent to Adobe Analytics.

  For information on installing, configuring, and implementing the Media Extension with tags, see [Adobe Media Analytics (3.x SDK) for Audio and Video extension overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/extensions/client/media-analytics-3x/overview.html).

* **Media SDK:**  Data is sent to Adobe Analytics.

  For information about downloading and installing Media SDKs and extensions, see [Get Media SDKs, Extensions using Tags, and OTT SDKs](/help/getting-started/download-sdks.md).

* **Media Collection API:** Track audio and video events using RESTful HTTP calls. Data is sent to Adobe Analytics.

  For information about using the Media Collection APIs, see [Media Collection APIs](media-collection-api/mc-api-overview.md).

<!--
(Not sure if we need the following paragraph and graphic. Paragraph is somewhat redundant with the intro paragraph of this article)
Choose the implementation method depending on the supported platforms. Some players are not supported by the Media SDKs or the Adobe Experience Platform Media Extensions. The Media Collection APIs provide a way to support those players. For information on supported devices, see [Supported devices and platforms](/help/getting-started/supported-devices.md).
