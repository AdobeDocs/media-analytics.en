# Client-side{#client-side}

Media Analytics (Heartbeats) is Adobeâ€™s standardized media tracking solution. that replaced Adobe's Milestone model.

Client Side integrations are implemented with Media Analytics only. You can choose to implement either the Media SDK or the Media Collection API (or both). The client-side path can be used across any player, including customer and/or OVP players such as Brightcove, Ooyala, thePlatform, and so on.

If Media Analytics is your intended path, see [Media SDK Implementation](/help/sdk-implement/setup/setup-overview.md) and [Media Collection API.](/help/media-collection-api/mc-api-overview.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To use Media Analytics, customers must also use Adobe Analytics.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Customers need to contact their Sales Representative/Account Manager to sign a new Sales Order, because Media Analytics has a unique SKU, and changes from a pricing model based on server calls to a model based on media streams.
