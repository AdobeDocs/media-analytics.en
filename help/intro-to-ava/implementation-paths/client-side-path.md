# Client-side

Video Analytics (Heartbeats) is Adobeâ€™s standardized video solution. It has replaced Adobe's older Milestone model.

Client Side integrations are implemented with Video Analytics only. You can choose to implement either the Video Heartbeat SDK or the Media Collection API (or both). The client-side path can be used across any video player, including customer and/or OVP players such as Brightcove, Ooyala, thePlatform, and so on.

If Video Analytics is your intended path, see [VA SDK Implementation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/hbvideo/c_vhl_stand-implement.html).and [](../../media-collection-api/media-collection-api.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To use Video Analytics, customers must also use Adobe Analytics.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Customers need to contact their Sales Representative/Account Manager to sign a new Sales Order as Video Analytics has a unique SKU and changes from a pricing model based on server calls to a model based on video streams.
