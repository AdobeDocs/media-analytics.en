# Adobe Experience Platform Launch{#adobe-launch}

Media Analytics (Heartbeats) is Adobeâ€™s standardized media tracking solution. It has replaced Adobe's older Milestone model.

Adobe Experience Platform Launch, the follow-on product to Dynamic Tag Management, features a Launch extension that facilitates implementing tracking in your media players.

You can learn more about the Launch extension here: [Adobe Media Analytics for Audio and Video Extension.](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/launch/using/extensions-ref/adobe-extension/media-analytics-extension/overview.html)

>[!NOTE]
>
>For this implementation path, customers need to contact their Sales Representative/Account Manager to sign a new Sales Order as Media Analytics has a unique SKU and changes from a pricing model based on server calls to a model based on media streams.
