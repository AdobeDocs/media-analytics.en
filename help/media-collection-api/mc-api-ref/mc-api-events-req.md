# Events request{#events-request}

```
POST 
https://{uri}/api/v1/sessions/{sid}/events 
```

## URI Parameter

`sid`: The session ID returned from a [Sessions request.](/help/media-collection-api/mc-api-ref/mc-api-sessions-req.md)

## Request Body

The request body must be JSON, and must have the same structure as this sample request body:

```
{ 
    "playerTime": { 
        "playhead": 0, 
        "ts": 1509045324153 
    }, 
    "eventType": "{event-type}", 
    "params": {}, 
    "qoeData": {}, 
    "customMetadata": {} 
}
```

* `playerTime` (Mandatory)
   * `playhead` - Must be in seconds, but it can be a float.
   * `ts` - Timestamp; must be in milliseconds.
* `eventType` (Mandatory)
* `params` (Optional) 
* `customMetadata` (Optional; send only with `adStart` and `chapterStart` event types)
* `qoeData` (Optional)

For a list of valid event types for this release, see [Event types and descriptions.](/help/media-collection-api/mc-api-ref/mc-api-event-types.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>***Ad Tracking -** You can only track ads inside an `adBreak`*. 
>
>In the absence of the `adBreakStart` and `adBreakComplete` "bookends" around ads, `adStart` and `adComplete` events will simply be ignored, and the corresponding ad duration will be tracked as main content duration. This could have a significant impact on the aggregated data which will be available in Adobe Analytics.
