# Custom metadata support{#custom-metadata-support}

You can provide custom key/value pairs on the `sessionStart` and `adStart` events. This information must be provided in the JSON key, `customMetadata`, positioned alongside the `params` key.

The `customMetadata` JSON key should contain an object of key/value pairs. The key should contain only alphanumerical characters, underline, and dot/period.
