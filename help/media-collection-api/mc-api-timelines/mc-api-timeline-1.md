## Action details

### Action 1 - Start session {#Action-1}

| Auto-play or Play button pressed, video starts loading.  | 0 | 0 | `/api/v1/sessions` |

**Implementation Detail**

This call signals _the user's intention to play_ a video. <br/><br/>It returns a Session ID ( `{sid}`) to the client that is used to identify all subsequent tracking calls within the session. The player state is not yet "playing", but is instead "starting". <br/><br/>[Mandatory session parameters ](/help/media-collection-api/mc-api-ref/mc-api-sessions-req.md) must be included in the `params` map in the request body. <br/><br/>On the backend, this call generates an Adobe Analytics initiate call.

    }, eventType:sessionComplete
}
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>**No Seek Events? -** There is no explicit support in the Media Collection API for `seekStart` or `seekComplete` events. This is because certain players generate a very large number of such events when the end-user is scrubbing, and several hundred users could easily bottleneck the network bandwidth of a backend service. Adobe works around explicit support for seek events by computing heartbeat duration based on device timestamp, rather than playhead position.
