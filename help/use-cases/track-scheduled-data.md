# Upload schedule data to track live content

You can upload schedule data of past live Streaming Media content to more easily and accurately track viewership of live content. 

The following are examples of live content that are supported with schedule data upload:

* FAST (Free Ad Supported TV) platforms 

* Local streams

* Live sports

Uploading schedule data allows you to track viewership data for individual programs that ran during the time you designate in the upload file. You can even gather viewership data for specific topics or program segments. 

These capabilities are available regardless of how you implemented Streaming Media Collection.

## Capabilities

Schedule data uploads of past live Streaming Media content includes the following capabilities to help analyze program performance:

* **Accurately track program schedules**: Identify the start and end times of each individual program in the live stream for the period of time that you want to analyze. With accurate start and end times, the precise running time is accurately reflected and can be analyzed against each viewer session.

  For example, precise beginning and end times are not always known for a live sporting event until the event is over. Schedule data uploads allow you to get accurate reporting by updating the start and end times after the program finishes.

* **Track individual topics or program segments**: Create new time-based dimensions for specific topics or program segments (time slots) within a given program. These time-based dimensions allow you to analyze viewership of a program at a more specific level, helping to gather insights about which topics or program segments resonated best.

  For example, when analyzing a live sporting event, such as a soccer match, you can create separate dimensions for the first half, half time, and second half. This allows for more detailed breakdowns of viewer behavior for specific segments of a program.

* **Build user journeys in Journey Optimizer**: Track which programs a person viewed in a given session (or even which topics or program segments the person viewed), then use this data in Adobe Journey Optimizer to build user journeys for customers who watched a certain program or who showed interest in a particular topic.  

## Prerequisites

To upload schedule data of past live content, you must meet the following prerequisites:

* Streaming Media Collection must be enabled for tracking on the content for which you want to upload schedule data, as described in [Tracking overview](/help/use-cases/track-av-playback/track-core-overview.md). <!--specifics??? -->

* Use Streaming Media Collection with Customer Jourey Analytics. This functionality is not available with Adobe Analytics.

## Request and upload the schedule data file

The process for uploading schedule data of past live content requires a `.json` file that you request from Adobe Customer Care, fill out, and then upload to a cloud location. 

The schedule data `.json` file contains the required structure for analyzing schedule data. 

To request, fill out, and upload the schedule data file:

1. Request the schedule data file from Adobe Customer Care.

   1. Log a support ticket with Adobe Customer Care.

   1. Include the following information: ???

      Adobe Customer Care will respond to your request within ____ days. Their response contains a `.json` file that contains the fields you need to fill out.

1. Fill out the schedule data file that you receive from Adobe Customer Care.

   1. Open the `.json` file that you recieve from Adobe Customer Care
   
   1. Specify the following information:

      * **Matching key**: The channel ID or content ID of the live data that you want to analyze.

      * **Dimension**: The base-level dimensions that you want to create. These dimensions represent the standard way of categorizing your content, such as by episode, game, or an individual topic. 

        Consider the following examples of dimensions you could create and then report on in Customer Journey Analytics:

        * **["_Episode name_"](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/audio-video-parameters#episode)**: This dimension could help you learn which episodes in a particular series are performing best.

        * **"Super bowl**": This dimension could help you gather data about an individual game, such as the super bowl in American football. 

      * **Start time**: The timestamp of when in the live content you want the analysis to start. <!--what format to include this in?-->

      * **End time**: The timestamp of when in the live content you want the analysis to stop.

        >[!IMPORTANT]
        >
        >If you have multiple schedule data requests, they cannot have overlapping start and end times.

      * **Additional metadata**: Any new time-based dimensions that you want to create that builds on the base dimension. These can represent a program, program segment, or an individual topic. 

        Consider the following examples of dimensions you could create and then report on in Customer Journey Analytics:
        
        * **["_Season name_"](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/audio-video-parameters#season)**: Building on your standard dimension of "_Episode name_", this dimension could help you learn which viewers are watching a particular season of a television series so that you can learn which seasons of a particular series are performing best.
        
        * **["_Show name_"](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/media-analytics/using/implementation/variables/audio-video-parameters#show)**: Building on your standard dimension of "_Episode name_", this dimension could help you learn which viewers are watching a particular television series so that you can create targeted marketing campaigns for similar television series that are released.

        * **"Sitcom"**: This dimension could help you understand the popularity of sitcoms compared to other types of televisions shows, for which you could also create dimensions, such as **"Drama"** or "**Game show**". 
        
        * **"Halftime show"**: This dimension could help you learn how viewership changes at the halftime of sporting events, such as the super bowl, so you can adjust future advertisements to better match viewership. 

        * **"Football"**: This dimension could help you learn which viewers are interested in a particular topic, like football, so that you can create targeted marketing campaigns to support future programming of college and professional football.

1. Send the completed data file to Adobe Customer Care.

   1. Upload your completed data file to a cloud location, such as an Amazon S3 bucket.
   
   1. Notify Adobe Customer Care of the location.

      After your file is uploaded, Adobe Customer Care will run the Analysis and send you the `.json` schema.

   1. Specify whether this is a one-time or recurring request. <!--is this true? How do they do this? Or is it always recurring? -->

1. Continue with [Analyze data in Customer Journey Analytics](#analyze-data-in-customer-journey-analytics).

You can track which programs a person viewed in a given session, or even which topics or program segments they viewed. These capabilities are available regardless of how you implemented Streaming Media Collection.
Previously, it was difficult to accurately tie a given session to specific programs when analyzing live content, and it wasn't possible to tie a given session to individual topics or program segments.
Schedule data uploads of live content in Streaming Media Collection includes the following capabilities:
Upload schedules for past live content, regardless of your Streaming Media Collection implementation.
Identify the start and end times of each individual program in the live stream for the period of time that you want to analyze. With accurate start and end times, the precise running time is accurately reflected and can be analyzed against each viewer session.
