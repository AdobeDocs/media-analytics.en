## Action details

### Action 1 - Start session {#Action-1}

| Action | Action Timeline (Seconds) | Playhead position (Seconds) | Client Request |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| Auto-play or Play button pressed, video starts loading.  | 0 | 0 | `/api/v1/sessions` |

This call signals _the user's intention to play_ a video.

It returns a Session ID ( `{sid}`) to the client that is used to identify all subsequent tracking calls within the session. The player state is not yet "playing", but is instead "starting".

Mandatory session parameters must be included in the `params` map in the request body. For information about sessions, see the Media Collection API documentation.

On the backend, this call generates an Adobe Analytics initiate call.

```json
{
    "playerTime": {
        "playhead": 0,
        "ts": "<timestamp>"
    },
    "eventType":"sessionStart, params" {
        "media.playerName": "sample-html5-api-player",
        "analytics.trackingServer": "[ _YOUR_TS_ ]",
        "analytics.reportSuite": "[ _YOUR_RSID_ ]",
        "analytics.visitorId": "[ _YOUR_VISITOR_ID_ ]",
        "media.contentType": "VOD",

| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |

| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| User pressed Play to resume main content | 74 | 31 | `/api/v1/sessions/{sid}/events` |

Move the play state to "playing".  **The `play` call after a `pauseStart` infers a "resume" call to the back end,** so there is no need for a `resume` event.

```json

{
    "playerTime": {
        "playhead": 45,
        "ts": "<timestamp>"
    }, "eventType": "sessionComplete"
}
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>**No Seek Events? -** There is no explicit support in the Media Collection API for `seekStart` or `seekComplete` events. This is because certain players generate a very large number of such events when the end-user is scrubbing, and several hundred users could easily bottleneck the network bandwidth of a backend service. Adobe works around explicit support for seek events by computing heartbeat duration based on device timestamp, rather than playhead position.
