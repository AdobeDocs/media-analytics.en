# Migrating from the standalone Media SDK to Adobe Launch

>[!NOTE]
>Adobe Experience Platform Launch has been rebranded as a suite of data collection technologies in Experience Platform. Several terminology changes have rolled out across the product documentation as a result. Please refer to the following [document](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/tags/term-updates.html?lang=en) for a consolidated reference of the terminology changes.

This documentation focuses mainly on Media Analytics implementation differences
between the standalone Media SDK and the Media Analytics Launch extension.

Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics,
marketing, and advertising solutions necessary to power relevant customer
experiences across web and mobile. Launch empowers anyone to build and maintain
their own integrations with Launch. These integrations are called extensions.
Extensions are available to Launch customers in an app-store experience, so they
can quickly install, configure, and deploy their solutions.

Adobe Media Analytics for Audio and Video is available as a Launch extension for both web and mobile:
