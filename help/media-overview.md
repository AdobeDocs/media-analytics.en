![Banner](./assets/media_analytics_banner.png)

Adobe Analytics for Streaming Media is an add-on to Adobe Analytics that provides powerful measurement tools for audio, video, and advertisements. With Analytics for Streaming Media, you get near real-time, granular details of duration, stops and starts that lets you evaluate and combine video and audio metrics. These insights allow you to understand your customers' viewing and listening habits and increase engagement with highly personalized recommendations.

Adobe Analytics for Streaming Media enables you to track the full customer journey across your site and streaming apps. You can combine Streaming Media metrics with other Adobe Analytics capabilities, such as Audience Analytics, Mobile, or Cross-Device Analytics. The metrics easily integrate into Adobe Analytics Reports and other Adobe Experience Platform products. Media measurement allows you to categorize your data into multiple dimensions and segments, capturing all of the metadata you need to do a complete and detailed analysis. You can then analyze data and attribute success criteria to fully consumed media, average time spent, and completed ads.

You can measure vital delivery metrics related to Quality of Experience (QoE) such as dropped frames, time spent buffering, and average bitrate. And the metrics can be combined with your website or app data to visualize the customer path and interests---to provide enhanced recommendations and personalize customer experiences using Adobe Experience Platform.

## How it works

Streaming media tracking data is collected from a player using the Media SDKs, the Media Collection APIs, or the Media Extensions (with Tags). All granular data (up to 10 seconds) is sent to the Media Analytics Service that collects and process the data for each individual playback session. Once a playback session ends, the computed tracking data is sent to Adobe Analytics for storage and reporting. With Adobe Customer Journey Analytics (CJA) implementations, data can be sent to CJA using the Analytics Data Connector (ADC) so that customers could use CJA as a reporting tool.
