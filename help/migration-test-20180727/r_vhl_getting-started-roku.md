# Getting started


Before you can use Video Heartbeat 2.x in Roku, you must set up an Experience Cloud account, enable the Visitor ID service, and obtain valid configuration parameters for measuring video heartbeats.

## Get the SDK {#section_DC5B6C26CD124C5087EA7BC7A67F7E16}

The `AdobeMobileLibrary-2.*-Roku.zip` download file consists of the following software components: 
* `adbmobile.brs`: This library file will be included in your Roku app source folder.

* `ADBMobileConfig.json` This SDK configuration file is customized for your app.


Add the library file and json config file to your project source.
