# Adobe Debug

Optionally, you can debug payloads (Heartbeat and Adobe Analytics) going out of the Video Heartbeat Library using the Adobe Debug tool, which is a freely available tool from Adobe for Video Heartbeat customers.
To use Adobe Debug, you need to contact your Adobe representative for the initial setup and registration. After you gain access to Adobe Debug, go to [Adobe Debug help](https://debug.adobe.com/login?next=/#/help/) to see the help information.
