# Analytics and Ratings Path

For the Nielsen partnership, Adobe created a Combo SDK that comprises the Nielsen and Adobe Heartbeat SDKs. With one implementation, customers can capture data for analytics and ratings (Nielsenâ€™s Digital Content Ratings). To leverage this partnership, a customer must complete the following steps:

1. Sign an Adobe Sales Order for the Video Analytics SKU, based on streams.
1. Sign an Adobe Addendum in which the customer gives permission to Adobe to share data directly with Nielsen.
1. Contact your Nielsen Account team and complete paperwork from Nielsen to leverage Digital Content Ratings (DCR).
1. After completing steps 1-3, contact your Adobe Account Manager to get the location where you can download the Combo SDK. 
   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The Combo SDK is not available on GitHub.



For more information about the partnership and how to implement this path, see [Digital Content Ratings, powered by Adobe](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/sc/appmeasurement/hbvideo/nielsen/). 
With this partnership, to ensure proper implementation and to guarantee quality data based on agreed upon standardized metrics, Adobe will certify your builds before you release them to production.
