# Video Data Insertion APIs

When using the API, during playback you will determine which events and metadata that you want to send to Adobe with server calls. However, these API calls are completely independent of Adobe's Video Analytics solution (Heartbeats). This means that you cannot leverage Adobe's solution/reserved variables to standardize your video implementation, nor will Adobe send any of this data to our ratings partners.
For more information about the Data Insertion API, see [Data Insertion: Overview](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/data-insertion/c-data-insertion-api).
