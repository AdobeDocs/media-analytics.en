# Video Analytics via Media Heartbeats

"The APIs belonging to media heartbeats enable real--time dashboards and other media reporting capabilities. This guide is intended for a media integration engineer who has an understanding of the APIs and workflow of the media player being instrumented. Implementing these APIs requires that your media player provide the following: "
"• An API to subscribe to player events. The media heartbeat requires that you call a set of simple APIs when events occur in your player. "
"• An API or class that provides player information, such as media name and play--head position. "
