# Overview

Certification is the process in which both the customer and the ratings partner run through a series of test cases to ensure proper implementation of the SDK across both sites and Apps. Only through certification can we ensure proper collection of data to ensure accuracy of syndicated ratings data.

There are two types of certification:

* Full certification 
* Self certification

To determine which type of certification to use, see [](../../nielsen-partnership/certification/cert-process.md).

A key component of both certification types is Adobe Debug. It lets you generate logs for defined use cases and then submit those logs for review. Subsequent sections explain the certification process, along with what you should test and what results to expect, and how you can leverage Adobe Debug.
