>A critical part of certification is to prevent reporting discrepancies by verifying that the data passed between Adobe and Nielsen match. If any of these values are set incorrectly, it could affect reporting.

When making a certification request, complete the certification request form and send it to your certification consultant. You must submit one request per platform (iOS/Android/JS).
