# Certification process{#certification-process}

## Full certification criteria {#section_0BFC4F2C34364621AA1A26410731D45E}

Here are the use cases and circumstances for a full certification and a self certification.

* First Time Certifications:

    * The first time a video player within an app or site is tagged with the Joint Adobe/Nielsen SDK a full certification is required. 
    * Each video player within a site or app requires a separate certification.

* Re-Certifications:

    * If significant changes are made to the video player within an app or site (such as changing video player providers or changing ad services), a full certification is required.

## Self certification criteria {#section_0206A312318D499BA0E5FE0A06615829}

Here are the criteria for self-certification:

* When the Adobe Media SDK is updated a self certification is required. 
* If another Brand, within the same company, leverages the same player implementation and the player is simply "re-skinned", a self certification is required.
