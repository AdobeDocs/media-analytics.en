# Default reports overview{#default-reports-overview}

Adobe Analytics provides several reports and metrics to track media performance on your website.

In addition to the metrics and dimensions available when you enable each of the modules, there are three additional dashboard-style reports that become available when you enable the Media Core module. Enabling the Ads module also changes the appearance of some of these dashboard-style reports by adding additional metrics and filters.

Media reports are listed on the **[!UICONTROL Reports]** tab. Navigate to > **[!UICONTROL Media]** > **[!UICONTROL Media Engagement]** and select from:
