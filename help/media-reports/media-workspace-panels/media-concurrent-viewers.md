# Media Concurrent Viewers Reporting{#media-concurrent-viewers}

Analyzing concurrent viewers enables you to understand where peak concurrency occurred or where drop-offs happened to provide valuable insight into the quality of content and viewer engagement, and to help with troubleshooting or planning for volume and scale.

## Media Concurrent Viewers Panel in Analysis Workspace

In Analysis Workspace, Concurrent Viewers is the number of unique visitors viewing your media stream(s) at a specific point in time, regardless of the number of sessions. The Media Concurrent Viewers panel is available in order to visualize concurrent viewers, break down, and compare.

## Get Concurrent Viewers via Analytics Reporting API

You can also get concurrent viewer data for up to 1-month at a time at minute-level granularity using the Analytics Reporting API 2.0.  The reporting API uses the same definition of concurrent viewers as Analysis Workspace.  For more information see [_*Get concurrent viewers JSON report data with Analytics 2.0 APIs*_](/help/media-reports/media-default-reports/get-concurrent-json20.md).
