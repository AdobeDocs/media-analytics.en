# AppleTV implementation with tvOS

With the release of the new Apple TV, you can now create applications to run in the native tvOS environment. You can either create a purely native app, using any of several frameworks available in iOS, or you can create your app using XML templates and JavaScript. Starting with ` MediaHeartbeatLibrary` version 2.0, support for tvOS is available.
