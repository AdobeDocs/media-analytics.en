# Opt-out and privacy settings

You can control whether Video Heartbeat activity is allowed on a specific device. A ` MediaHeartbeat` object respects the ` VisitorAPI` privacy and opt­out settings. To opt­out of Video Heartbeat tracking, you need to opt out from the Visitor API service. For further information on opt­out and privacy, see [ Experience Cloud ID Service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/).
