    <p>Before you begin your Adobe Analytics for Video implementation you have some early decisions
      to make, regarding which implementation scenario makes the most sense for your situation. The
      information in the following sections will help you determine how best to proceed: </p>
    <p>
      <ul id="ul_jgy_zcq_hbb">
        <li><b>Video Analytics</b> - Implement one of the Video Analytics implementation paths using
          the latest Video Analytics SDKs (recommended)</li>
        <li><b>Milestone</b> - Implement with Milestone (the older Adobe tracking
          implementation)</li>
        <li><b>Data Insertion APIs</b> - Implement without using Video Analytics SDKs (video
          tracking with Data Insertion APIs).</li>
      </ul>

      <title>Video Analytics Implementation Paths</title>
      <p>Video Analytics (using the Heartbeats model) is Adobe’s standardized video solution. It has
        replaced Adobe's older Milestone model. </p>
      <p>For each of the paths described below, customers will need to contact their Sales
        Representative/Account Manager to sign a new Sales Order as Video Analytics has a unique SKU
        and changes from a pricing model based on server calls to a model based on video streams. </p>
      <p>
        <ul id="ul_a3f_js1_lbb">
          <li><b>Video Analytics Path</b> - The Video Analytics path features the Video Analytics
            SDK, which can be used across any video player, including customer and/or OVP players
            such as Brightcove, Ooyala, thePlatform, and so on. <note type="important">To use Video
              Analytics, customers also need to use Adobe Analytics. If Video Analytics is your
              intended path, see <xref

          <li><b>Analytics and Ratings Path</b> - Adobe has partnered with Nielsen so that customers
            can opt-in to share data, collected by Adobe SDKs/tags, directly with Nielsen to provide
            the data that fuels their ratings solutions. For the Nielsen partnership, Adobe created
            a Combo SDK that comprises the Nielsen and Adobe Heartbeat SDKs. With one
            implementation, customers can capture data for analytics and ratings (Nielsen’s Digital
            Content Ratings). To leverage this partnership, a customer must complete the following
            steps: <p>
              <ol id="ol_b3f_js1_lbb">
                <li> Sign an Adobe Sales Order for the Video Analytics SKU, based on streams. </li>
                <li>Sign an Adobe Addendum in which the customer gives permission to Adobe to share
                  data directly with Nielsen. </li>
                <li>Contact your Nielsen Account team and complete paperwork from Nielsen to
                  leverage Digital Content Ratings (DCR). </li>
                <li>After completing steps 1-3, contact your Adobe Account Manager to get the
                  location where you can download the Combo SDK. <p>
                    <note>The Combo SDK is not available on GitHub.</note>
                  </p></li>
              </ol>
            </p><p>For more information about the partnership and how to implement this path, see

                format="html" scope="external">Digital Content Ratings, powered by Adobe</xref>.
              </p><p>With this partnership, to ensure proper implementation and to guarantee quality
              data based on agreed upon standardized metrics, Adobe will certify your builds before
              you release them to production. </p><note type="note"> To send data to our ratings
              partners, customers need to contact their Sales Representative/Account Manager to

          <li><b>Adobe Primetime Path</b> - Adobe Primetime is an Adobe Marketing Cloud solution
            that helps content programmers and distributors monetize video on every connected
            screen.  Primetime eliminates the complexity of reaching, monetizing, and activating
            global audiences across devices by providing a modular platform for video publishing,
            advertising, personalization, and analytics. Additionally, Primetime offers solutions
            and value around the following: <p>
              <ul id="ul_c3f_js1_lbb">
                <li>Support for accurately measuring Linear and VOD content types. </li>
                <li>Support for measuring ad breaks with (or without) dynamic ad insertion. </li>
                <li>TVSDK's seamless ad insertion model allows for analytics that directly measures
                  the ad playback, which increases accuracy. </li>
                <li>Robust set of events and metadata to ensure accuracy across QoS buffering or
                  mobile connectivity interruptions issues and end-user interactions such as

                  metadata. </li>
              </ul>
            </p><p>TVSDK is already integrated with the Video Analtyics (Heartbeats) SDK, which
              makes implementation much easier and faster across every supported platform. Primetime

      <title>Video Milestone Implementation (Old)</title>
      <p>The Video Milestone measurement model is the previous method Adobe supported to track
        video. This has since been replaced by the Video Analytics (Heartbeats) model.</p>
      <p>The Milestone model allows a completely custom implementation where customers can decide
        when and how frequently to send in server calls during playback. It was called "Milestone"
        because the most common implementations sent in server calls at the start, 25%, 50%, 75%,
        and at the completion of the video. The solution uses your own custom eVars and events to
        track video by using Adobe's Media Module. The Heartbeats solution was designed to build
        upon some of the limitations of Milestones, specifically around providing more granularity
        and accuracy around engagement and to provide a more standardized measurement solution
        across our entire customer base. </p>

      <p>The Milestone model can be used at the same time as the Heartbeats model in a specific
        report suite, but both solutions should not be used at the same time in the same player.
        Data captured from both models can live and be reported on in the same report suite. This
        will allow you to gradually migrate to the Heartbeats model without having to update
        everything at the same time. </p>

      <title>Video Data Insertion APIs</title>
      <p>The Data Insertion API is a way to track video playback on devices and platforms where
        Adobe does not currently have a Video Heartbeats SDK. HTTP POSTs and HTTP GETs enable a
        server-side method to collect data. </p>
      <p>When using the API, during playback you will determine which events and metadata that you
        want to send to Adobe with server calls. However, these API calls are completely independent
        of Adobe's Video Analytics solution (Heartbeats). This means that you cannot leverage
        Adobe's solution/reserved variables to standardize your video implementation, nor will Adobe
        send any of this data to our ratings partners. </p>
