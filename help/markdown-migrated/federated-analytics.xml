		<p>The Federated Analytics service provides a system for sharing Adobe Video Analytics data
			between two partners. The standardized video measurement data created by Adobe Video
			Analytics is the hallmark for Federated Analytics, allowing the same data to flow into a
			single report from multiple sources. Through the rules and logic governing Federated
			Analytics, data is easily controlled and individualized to meet the needs of each
			partnership. Federated Analytics makes video measurement more efficient, streamlined,
			and actionable.</p>
