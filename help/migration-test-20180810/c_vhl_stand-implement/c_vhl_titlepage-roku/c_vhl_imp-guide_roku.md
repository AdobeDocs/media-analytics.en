# Video Analytics via Media Heartbeat

The APIs belonging to media heartbeats enable real-time dashboards and other media reporting capabilities. This guide is intended for a media integration engineer who has an understanding of the APIs and workflow of the media player being instrumented. Implementing these APIs requires that your media player provide the following: 


* An API to subscribe to player events. The media heartbeat requires that you call a set of simple APIs when events occur in your player.
* An API or class that provides player information, such as media name and play-head position.
