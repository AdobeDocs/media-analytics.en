# Before You Begin

Before you begin your VHL implementation, you have some early decisions to make, regarding which implementation makes the most sense for your situation. The information in the following *Getting Started* sections will help you determine how best to proceed: 
* With one of the Video Analytics paths using the latest VHL SDKs (the standard, recommended implementation)
* With Milestone (the older Adobe tracking implementation)
* Without using VHL SDKs, implementing video tracking with Data Insertion APIs.
