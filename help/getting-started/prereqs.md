# Prerequisites{#prerequisites}

To implement Adobe Analytics for Streaming Media, complete the following tasks:

1. **Confirm your Steaming Media pricing model**<br>
The current pricing model is based on video streams. If necessary, contact your Sales Representative or Account Manager to sign a new Sales Order as Streaming Media Analytics is sold separately from Adobe Analytics.

1. **Confirm that you're implementing Adobe Analytics**<br>
Streaming Media for Adobe Analytics also requires an Adobe Analytics basic implementation. See [Implement Adobe Analytics](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/home.html) for more information.

1. **Obtain the media tracking server URL**<br>
Ask your Adobe Analytics Representative for the media tracking server URL. This is the `collection-api-server` URL for the Mobile SDK, the JavaScript SDK, and the non-collection-api tracking server for Roku. Domain names for API implementation is: `[your_namespace].hb-api.omtrdc.net`.

1. **Download the current Media SDK or implement the required Extensions**<br>
Depending on the implementation path, [download the current SDK](download-sdks.md) for web, mobile, or over-the-top platforms. The required extensions must be implemented to enable Adobe Analytics for Streaming Media. For information about required extensions, see [Adobe Extensions](download-sdks.md#media-extension). (NEED to clarify either download Media SDK or Get the Extension)

1. **Enable Adobe Analytics Reports**<br>
To enable reports in Analytics and to view the content and ad data that you're collecting, you must enable reports in Analytics. See [Media reports enablement.](/help/reporting/media-reports-enable.md).

1. **Enable Experience Cloud**<br>


## Implement the Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service. {#implement-id}

  The **Identity Service** enables the common identification framework for the Experience Cloud Core Services, solutions, and customer attributes and audiences in the People core service. It works by assigning a unique, persistent ID to a site visitor. When your organization implements the ID service, this ID lets you identify the same site visitor and their data in different Experience Cloud solutions.

  The ID service can also replace the different solution-specific IDs (for example, Analytics AID). Through the [Customer IDs and Authentication States](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/reference/authenticated-state.html) functionality, the ID service lets you pass in your own customer IDs to the Experience Cloud. Keep in mind, however, that the ID service only works with the solutions to which you have already subscribed. If you are not signed up for access to other products, the ID service does not provide the access.

  The ID service is an integral component of many Experience Cloud features, enhancements, and services. Currently, the ID service supports [Analytics,](https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html) [Audience Manager,](https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/data-management-platform.html) and [Target.](https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/testing-targeting.html)

  If you have not implemented the ID service, now is the time to start considering a migration strategy. For more information about the importance and role of the ID service, see [Why the Identity Service Should be on Your Radar.](https://theblog.adobe.com/why-new-adobe-marketing-cloud-id-service-should-be-on-your-radar/)

  For additional information about the Experience Cloud ID, see [Experience Cloud ID Overview,](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/intro/overview.html) and [Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/home.html).
