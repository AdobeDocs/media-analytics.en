# Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you begin implementing the Adobe Streaming Media Collection, complete the following tasks:

1. **Review the Streaming Media Collection overview**<br>
Before you begin implementing the Streaming Media Collection, review the [Streaming Media Collection overview](/help/media-overview.md) to make sure it meets your needs.

1. **Confirm your pricing model**<br>
The current pricing model for the Adobe Streaming Media Collection Add-on is based on video streams. If necessary, contact your Sales Representative or Adobe Account Team, as the add-on is sold separately for Adobe Analytics and Adobe Experience Platform.

1. **Enable Adobe Analytics Reports**<br>
To enable reports in Analytics or Customer Journey Analytics and to view the content and ad data that you're collecting, you must enable reports. See [Media reports enablement](/help/reporting/media-reports-enable.md).

1. **Implement the Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service in Experience Cloud**
   
   The **Identity Service** enables the common identification framework for the Experience Cloud Core Services, solutions, and customer attributes and audiences in the People core service. It works by assigning a unique, persistent ID to a site visitor. When your organization implements the ID service, this ID lets you identify the same site visitor and their data in different Experience Cloud solutions.

   The ID service can also replace the different solution-specific IDs (for example, Analytics AID). Through the [Customer IDs and Authentication States](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/reference/authenticated-state.html) functionality, the ID service lets you pass in your own customer IDs to the Experience Cloud. Keep in mind, however, that the ID service only works with the solutions to which you have already subscribed. If you are not signed up for access to other products, the ID service does not provide the access.

   The ID service is an integral component of many Experience Cloud features, enhancements, and services. Currently, the ID service supports [Analytics,](https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/web-analytics.html) [Audience Manager,](https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/data-management-platform.html) and [Target.](https://www.adobe.com/marketing-cloud/testing-targeting.html)

   If you have not implemented the ID service, now is the time to start considering a migration strategy. For more information about the importance and role of the ID service, see [Why the Identity Service Should be on Your Radar.](https://theblog.adobe.com/why-new-adobe-marketing-cloud-id-service-should-be-on-your-radar/)

   For additional information about the Experience Cloud ID, see [Experience Cloud ID Overview,](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/intro/overview.html) and [Adobe Experience Platform Identity Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/home.html).

1. **View additional prerequisites for your implementation method** 
   
      Depending on how you plan to implement the Streaming Media Collection, view the prerequisites for either of the following implementation methods:
 
      * [Prerequisites for Adobe Analytics-only implementations](/help/implementation/media-sdk/setup/prerequisites-analytics.md)
   
      * [Prerequisites for Edge implementations](/help/implementation/edge/prerequisites-edge.md)

      Use the [Implementation overview](/help/implementation/overview.md) to determine which implementation method is right for you.
