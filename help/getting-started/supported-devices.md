# Supported devices and platforms {#devices-supported}

The Adobe Streaming Media Collection Add-on supports all major devices, including:

* iOS and Android smartphones and tablets
* OTT devices for Roku, Fire TV, and Android TV
* JavaScript browsers for desktop and laptop

The SDKs are routinely updated when new versions of devices are released, and you can use the SDKs to integrate with native players of each individual platform or any other media player available.

For devices that don't currently have SDK support or in situations where you may need to customize your implementation, you can use the Media Collection API or Media Edge API. These APIs allow you to make RESTful API calls directly from a device to the Media Analytics backend.

The table below lists currently supported devices. If a device is not listed, contact your customer care or solution consultant for the status of that device.

For more information about implementing Media on Edge, see [Install Media Analytics with Experience Platform Edge](/help/implementation/edge/implementation-edge.md).
