## Implement error tracking

1. Track media player errors.

    On error events, call `trackError` with the error information.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Tracking media player errors will not stop the media tracking session. If the media player error prevents the playback from continuing, make sure that the media tracking session is closed by calling `trackSessionEnd` after calling `trackError`.
