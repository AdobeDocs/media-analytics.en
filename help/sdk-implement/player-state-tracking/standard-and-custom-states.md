# About standard and custom states

Five standard player states are available and you can add your own custom states.

|  Standard State Name  |  Media SDK constant                      |  Media Collection API name  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|  Full Screen          |  `ADB.Media.PlayerState.Fullscreen`        |  `fullScreen`                 |
|  Closed Captioning    |  `ADB.Media.PlayerState.ClosedCaptioning`  |  `closedCaptioning`           |
|  Mute                 |  `ADB.Media.PlayerState.Mute`              |  `mute`                       |
|  Picture in Picture   |  `ADB.Media.PlayerState.PictureInPicture`  |  `pictureInPicture`           |
|  In Focus             |  `ADB.Media.PlayerState.InFocus`           |  `inFocus`                    |

The data is computed in the same way for standard and custom states but the data is stored differently for Analytics reporting.

**For standard states**—When you enable the player state tracking from the Media Management console in Analytics reporting (admin side), 15 solution variables are available for reporting and data exports.

**For custom states**—You can create your own processing rules to store the computed values into custom events and then use those rules for reporting and data exports.

## Guidelines

* One video session is limited to 10 player states.
* Any combination of states is allowed.
* If multiple player states pass, only the first 10 are retained and forwarded downstream to the VA processing component.
* The maximum of 10 states is applied for all the states, no matter if they are closed or not.
* A state can start and end multiple times and it is counted as a single state. For example, `closedCapationing` can be started and stopped five times but it will count as a single state.
* Every state that exceeds the maximum of 10 allowed states are discarded.

## Custom states

With the ability to create custom states, you can capture custom actions and update custom metadata during a playback session.

For information about creating custom states, see the [Media API Reference guide: `createStateObject`](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-media-analytics/media-api-reference#createstateobject)
