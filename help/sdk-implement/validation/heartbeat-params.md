| s:event:type | R | Media SDK | The type of the event being tracked. Event types: <ul> <li> s:event:type=start </li> <li> s:event:type=complete </li> <li> s:event:type=chapter_start </li> <li> s:event:type=chapter_complete </li> <li> s:event:type=buffer </li> <li> s:event:type=pause </li> <li> s:event:type=resume </li> <li> s:event:type=bitrate_change </li> <li> s:event:type=aa_start </li> <li> s:event:type=stall </li> <li> s:event:type=end </li> </ul> |
| l:event:prev_ts | R | Media SDK | The timestamp of the last event of the same type in this session. The value is -1. |
| l:event:ts | R | Media SDK | The timestamp of the event.  |
| l:event:duration | R | Media SDK | This value is set internally (in milliseconds) by the Media SDK, not by the player. It is used to compute the time spent metrics on the backend. E.g.: a.media.totalTimePlayed is computed as a sum of the duration for all of the Play (type=play) heartbeats that are generated. <br/>*Note:* This parameter is set to 0 for certain events because they are "state change events" (e.g., type=complete, type=chapter_complete, or type=bitrate_change.) |
| l:event:playhead | R | VideoInfo | The playhead was inside the currently active asset (main or ad), when the event was recorded.  |
| s:event:sid | R | Media SDK | The session ID (a randomly generated string). All events in a certain session (video + ads) should be the same.  |
| l:asset:duration / l:asset:length <br/>(Renamed from length duration) | R | VideoInfo | The video asset length of the main asset.  |
| s:asset:publisher | R | MediaHeartbeatConfig | The publisher of the asset.  |

| l:aam:loc_hint | R | MediaHeartbeatConfig | AAM data sent on each payload after aa_start |
| s:aam:blob | R | MediaHeartbeatConfig | AAM data sent on each payload after aa_start |
| s:sc:rsid | R | Report Suit ID (or IDs) | Adobe Analytics RSID where reports should be sent.  |
| s:sc:tracking_server | R | MediaHeartbeatConfig | Adobe Analytics tracking server.  |
