# Track app states{#track-app-states}

States are the different screens or views in your application. Each time a new state is displayed in your application, you should send a `trackState` call. For example, when a user navigates from the home page to the video details screen, send a `trackState` call. States are typically viewed by using a pathing report, so you can see how users navigate your app and which states are most commonly viewed. 

## trackState calls

You typically call `trackState` each time the app loads a new screen.

### Roku

```js
ADBMobile().trackState("State Name", {})
```

### Chromecast

```js
ADBMobile.analytics.trackState("State Name",{});
```

The state name is reported in the "View State" variable in Adobe Mobile services, and a view is recorded for each `trackState` call. In other Analytics interfaces, "View State" is reported as "Page Name"; "State Views" is reported as "Page Views".

## Send context data

In addition to "State Name", you can send additional context data with each track state call.

### Roku

```js
dictionary = { } 
dictionary["myapp.login.LoginStatus"] = "logged in"  
ADBMobile().trackState("Home Screen", dictionary)
```

### Chromecast

```js
var dictionary = { }; 
dictionary["myapp.login.LoginStatus"] = "logged in"; 
ADBMobile.analytics.trackState("Home Screen", dictionary); 
```

>
>Context data values must be mapped to custom variables in Adobe Mobile services.
