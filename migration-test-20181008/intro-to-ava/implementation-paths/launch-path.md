# Adobe Launch

Video Analytics (Heartbeats) is Adobeâ€™s standardized video solution. It has replaced Adobe's older Milestone model.

Adobe Launch, the follow-on product to Dynamic Tag Management, features a Video Analytics Launch Extension that facilitates implementing video tracking in your players.

You can learn more about VA Launch here: [](https://docs.adobelaunch.com/extension-reference/adobe-analytics-for-video-extension)

>[!NOTE]
>
>For this implementation path, customers need to contact their Sales Representative/Account Manager to sign a new Sales Order as Video Analytics has a unique SKU and changes from a pricing model based on server calls to a model based on video streams.
